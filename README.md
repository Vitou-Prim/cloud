# Front-End Web Development Final Project (Javascript-Oriented Project)

Notice: There is only one submission/commit for this GitHub. This is because most of the work was done offline and shared in other ways. Most of the time on this project was spent on testing features and implementing them individually and then integrating them into our final project. While we know that we were instructed to utilize GitHub for this project, there were too many issues regarding Git and GitHub on our end. Git was not pushing and pulling at times while giving command errors at other times. As we are not experts at Git and GitHub, we decided to simply work our way around using other notes. If you would like to have a look at each of our contributions, please have a look below. We apologize if this inconveniences you in any way and we hope you understand.
